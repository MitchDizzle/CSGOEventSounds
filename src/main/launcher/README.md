# Event Sounds ${version}  
  
To run this script (with default sound config) just run the 'RunEventSounds.bat'  
Don't forget to put the cfg/gamestate_integration_eventsounds.cfg into your csgo/cfg/ folder, and restart the game!  
  
  
# Custom Event Sounds Script  
  
The runeventsounds_custom is used for custom arguments, i.e. a custom config, port or authkey.  
The arguments that can be passed through:  
```  runeventsounds_custom.bat <sound_config> [port] [auth_key] ```  
Since this is a local server there really isn't a reason to have an auth key. But it's there.
